After graduating from Florida Atlantic University in December 2019 with a degree in business economics, I began an applied economics masters program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a concentration in resource and energy demand analysis.

As someone who has always been passionate about energy and sustainability, I'm eager to begin a career that meshes my economic background with these interests. Upon graduation in July 2021, I hope to work as a consultant or analyst in the energy industry or a related area.
