# Introduction
After graduating from Florida Atlantic University in December 2019 with a degree in business economics, I began an applied economics masters program in June 2020 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a concentration in resource and energy demand analysis.

As someone who has always been passionate about energy and sustainability, I'm eager to begin a career that meshes my economic background with these interests.  I love econometrics and working with data to solve problems, so I am excited by the prospect of being able to use these in my career.  Upon graduating in July 2021, I will be beginning a full time position as a consultant for the Energy, Sustainability, and Infrastructure practice at Guidehouse in Boulder, Colorado.
